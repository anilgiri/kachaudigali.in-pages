I&amp;rsquo;m just getting started with this blog, and I&amp;rsquo;m as excited as a kachaudi fresh out of the kadahi!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a well-made kachaudi, I aim to keep things simple yet satisfying. No fancy garnishes or unnecessary complexity - just good, honest content that hits the spot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for more! I&amp;rsquo;m just warming up the stove, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty more cooking in the kitchen. 🍳&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Kachaudi Gali</title><link>https://kachaudigali.in/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kachaudigali.in/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>New York has Park Avenue, almost every city in India has a MG (Mahatma Gandhi)Road .. but when you talk of streets, Banaras has Kachaudi Gali (कचौड़ी गली). Its an alley not a road, and is named after a famous savoury snack that is made of a blend of spicy stuffing in a round flat dough of refined wheat flour, that is deep fried. This description did not do justice to kachaudi as a snack, just like this blog will never do justice to Kachaudi Gali as a phenomenon.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
